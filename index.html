      <p><em>U</em>timately, One has to understand that desires change. The things we want in our life are allowed to go into flux and change our direction. Most things we experience in life are impossible to describe to others. Things like <scan1>Heartbreak</scan1> and <scan2>Anxiety</scan2> are untouchable, though they happen to everyone. Explaining yourself to <strike>those heartless assholes</strike> people who choose to let you go is unnecessary. <br><br>Change is hard, but you are never alone. </p><br>

           <blockquote>
  "You do not have to be good. 
  You do not have to walk on your knees for a hundred miles through the desert, repenting. 
  You only have to let the soft animal of your body 
love what it loves.
Tell me about despair, yours, and I will tell you mine.
Meanwhile the world goes on.
Meanwhile the sun and the clear pebbles of the rain
are moving across the landscapes,
over the prairies and the deep trees,
the mountains and the rivers.
Meanwhile the wild geese, high in the clean blue air,
are heading home again.
Whoever you are, no matter how lonely,
the world offers itself to your imagination,
calls to you like the wild geese, harsh and exciting â€“
over and over announcing your place
  in the family of things."<br><i>--Mary Oliver</i></blockquote></p>
  <p>I'm just sayin'....Set some goals. Crush them. And when people ask if you're serious, Give em <a href="http://www.placecage.com/c/140/200">this look</a> before you slap them in the face with your triumphant hand.</p>
